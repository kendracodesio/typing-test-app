The Project: Typing Speed & Accuracy Test
By: Kendra Reynolds
Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript


My experience working on the project: My project relays heavily on manipulating
the DOM with JavaScript and using event handlers. One of the main goals I wanted 
to accomplish on this project was making it interactive so that as a user types 
they can follow along with the text display to see if they make a mistake.
I did this by manipulating the DOM and creating a span element for every character
in the display output and comparing it to the user's keystroke(made possible with 
an event handler). When the character was correct or incorrect I was able to 
manipulate the CSS and change the class of that span element. While doing this, I also 
get the correct key and incorrect key count which was important for showing accuracy
results at the end.
I wanted each fact to show up separately on the display, but after making each 
character a span element, I found that it made that aspect of the project more difficult.
Eventually, I decided to add line breaks before each fact was added to the
display and updated the scroll settings to bring only the newly added fact into view. 
During the type test all facts are generated at random and then pushed to an new array so that 
the new array can be used to make sure the next generated fact has not already been displayed.
I initially made the project as a one minute test but later decided to add the options
of changing the timer with radio buttons. The radio buttons were created on using
HTML, but the value is accessed using JavaScript.
